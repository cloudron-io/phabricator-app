Phabricator, an open source, software development platform

### Accounts

The admin credentials are:

`username`: superadmin

`password`: changeme123

The application is already setup for Cloudron LDAP.

Post installation, you are presented with two login forms:
* LDAP form for the Cloudron users
* Username/login form for the `superadmin` user above

You can disable the username/login form and use LDAP exclusively as follows:
* Login as `superadmin` and link the account to your LDAP account. See 
`People` -> `Edit Settings` -> `External Accounts`).
* Once linked, uncheck 'Login Allowed' from the username/password auth 
provider.
