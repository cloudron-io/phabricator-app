Phabricator, an open source, software development platform

### Administrator Setup

The admin credentials are:

`username`: superadmin
`password`: changeme123

The application is already setup for Cloudron LDAP.

By default, you are presented with two login forms : LDAP form for the Cloudron users and username/login
form for the superadmin. To fix this, **Login as admin and link the account to your LDAP account**. After 
doing so, uncheck 'login' from the username/password auth provider. Doing so, will result in a single LDAP
login form.
